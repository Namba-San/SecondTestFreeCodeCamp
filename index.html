                <h2>Who was Saint Therese?</h2>
                <p>Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face was a young Carmelite with a passionate missionary spirit who, although she lived only 24 years, left a legacy of profound devotion to Christ. Born in France in 1873, she dedicated her life to God, offering even the smallest gestures of daily life. Her early death in 1897 did not prevent her from becoming an example of holiness and missionary love. Thérèse left us the inheritance of her spirituality, based on spiritual childhood, teaching us to cultivate an intimate relationship with Our Lord, in the silence and simplicity of our vocation.</p>

                    <h2>Childhood of Therese</h2>
                    <img src="https://github.com/Namba-San/SecondTestFreeCodeCamp/raw/main/pictures/santa-teresinha-crianca.jpg">
                    <p>Maria Francisca Teresa Martin, known as Saint Thérèse, was born on January 2, 1873, in Alençon, France, as the youngest of eight children. Her parents, Luís Joseph Aloys Martin and Zélia Marie Guérin, were devout Catholics who sought holiness and lived lives of constant prayer. Thérèse considered them examples of virtue and faith. In 2015, they were canonized, becoming models for couples seeking a holy marriage.</p>
                    <p>When Therese was only four years old, her mother passed away from cancer. In the following years, she saw her sisters enter the convent, while her father, Saint Louis, faced mental health struggles. Saint Thérèse's life was marked by suffering and growth, which led her to place her trust in divine providence and surrender her life to Jesus.</p>

                    <p>After the death of her mother, Zélie, and the departure of her sisters to the convent, Saint Thérèse went through a period of intense sadness and pain, often crying and feeling lonely. However, at the age of 10, she had a mystical experience with the Virgin Mary, who smiled at her, as she recalled: "It was through my prayers that I received the grace of the smile of the Queen of Heaven." This smile from Mary brought healing to her heart, leading to a profound transformation in her life.</p>

                    <h2>At Christmas, a Conversion</h2>
                    <img src="https://github.com/Namba-San/SecondTestFreeCodeCamp/raw/main/pictures/menino-jesus.jpg">
                    <p>At the age of 13, during Christmas, Saint Thérèse had a transformative experience with the Baby Jesus, realizing that He is the source of true conversion. This moment was crucial for her spiritual growth, and years later, she would take the name "Thérèse of the Child Jesus.</p>
                    <h2>From the Carmelite to Death</h2>
                    <p>Saint Thérèse joined the Carmelite Order at the age of 15, after seeking permission from Pope Leo XIII in Rome. Her primary focus was to pray for the salvation of sinners and for priests. Though she initially dreamed of becoming a missionary and dying for Christ, she realized her vocation was to serve God through prayer and everyday acts within the convent.</p>
                    <p>Thérèse passed away in 1897 at the age of 24 due to tuberculosis, just nine years after entering religious life. Despite her brief time on Earth, she left a profound legacy of devotion, dedicating every moment to offering her "roses" to Jesus Christ.</p>
